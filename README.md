# Uplo 🗄️🔗
Welcome to Uplo, an end-to-end encrypted (e2ee) temporary file sharing service. This open-source project is designed with privacy in mind, ensuring that your data is always protected. A public version is hosted on [e2ee.host](https://e2ee.host).

## Features

- 🔒 Privacy-First: Files are stored based on user preferences: removed after a set number of downloads, removed after a set amount of time, or stored indefinitely (though nothing is truly forever). We do not share your data with third parties unless required by law.
- 📂 File Hosting: Uplo allows you to host files temporarily or indefinitely, with end-to-end encryption.
- 📖 Open Source: Uplo is open-source and licensed under the MIT License. You're free to use, modify, and distribute the software under the terms of this license.
- 📝 Fully optional: Hashed IP Logging: Uplo can log the IPs for easy removal of unwanted files from one uploader.
